[C] State whether the following statements are True or False:

(a) ; is a valid statement.                                           [False]                          
(b) Ifs can be nested.                                                [True]
(c) If there are multiple statements in if or else blocks,
    they should be enclosed within a pair of {}.                      [True]
(d) If can occur within an if block but not in the else block.        [False]
(e) By default there is only one statement in if blcok and only
    one in the else block.                                            [False]
(f) Nothing happens on execution of a null statement.                 [True]


[D] Match the following pairs:

(a) Multiples statements         -->    {}
(b) else block                   -->    if-else
(c) ;                            -->    Null statement
(d) < > <= >= == !=              -->    Relational operators
(e) ==                           -->    Comparison operator
(f) + - * / %                    -->    Arithmetic operators
(g) =                            -->    Assignment operator
(h) Default control instruction  -->    Sequence
(i) Decision control instruction -->    Optional


[E] Which of the following are valid ifs?

(a) if(-25)    -->  Valid
(b) if(3.14)   -->  Valid
(c) if(a)      -->  Valid
(d) if(a + b)  -->  Valid
(e) if(a >= b) -->  Valid
